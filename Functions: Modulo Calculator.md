# Functions in Python: Modulo Calculator

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
Write a python program to define a function that accepts 2 values and return its sum, subtraction and multiplication.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1.Start the program.
2.Define a function (e.g., calculate) that accepts two parameters.
3.Inside the function:
    Find the sum of the two numbers.
    Find the subtraction of the two numbers.
    Find the multiplication of the two numbers.
4.Return all three results.
5.Read two numbers from the user.
6.Call the function with these two numbers.
7.Print the returned sum, subtraction, and multiplication.
8.End the program.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
def result(a, b):
    sum = a+b
    sub = a-b
    mul = a*b
    print(f"Sum is {sum}, Sub is {sub}, & Multiply is {mul}")

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
result(a,b)
